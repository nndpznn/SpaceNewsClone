## About the App
Ever wish you were always up-to-date space news? Now, with our app, you can expect the latest and greatest news surrounding space, rocket launches, and satellites delivered right to your phone. The app currently offers two tabs: *Reports*, which provides official ISS status reports updated daily, and *Articles*, which covers any other kind of interesting space-related events.

Developed by Nolan Nguyen and Matthew Savitt.
